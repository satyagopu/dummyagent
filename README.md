# AgentWeave - Project Documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start (For 2 Developers)

**You are here!** Ready to build AgentWeave together. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Read the Requirements (1 hour)
→ Open `SMARTBOTS_REQUIREMENTS.md`  
→ Understand what we're building

### Step 2: Read the Execution Plan (1 hour)
→ Open `AGILE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`  
→ See all 20 phases
→ Understand weekly routine

### Step 3: Start Phase 1! (Week 1-2)
→ Open `phases/phase1.md`  
→ Follow step-by-step setup guide  
→ Use SQLite (file-based) for now  
→ Get dev environment running  
→ Run tests and see them pass!  
→ Celebrate first milestone! 🎉

### Step 4: Continue with Phase 2
→ Create `phases/phase2.md` (copy template from execution plan)  
→ Implement authentication system  
→ Write tests and pass them  
→ Celebrate Phase 2 complete! 🎉

### Step 5: Keep Going!
→ One phase at a time (Phase 3, 4, 5...)  
→ Create phase file when starting each phase  
→ Write tests before moving on  
→ Celebrate every milestone!

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip tests to go faster
- ❌ Work more than 8 hours/day
- ❌ Move to next phase with failing tests
- ❌ Work alone on complex features
- ❌ Forget to document as you go
